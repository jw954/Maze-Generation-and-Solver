Unlike most implmentations, the Depth First Search Algorithm is implemented iteratively using a stack to emulate the call stack.
The Stanford C++ Library is used for data structure and displaying graphics to the console window.

Completed as an optional extension assignment for CS106B - Programming Abstraction course at Stanford.
