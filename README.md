## Generates a Mazes using an iterative Depth First Search and Solves the Maze using Breadth First Search
Unlike most implmentations, the Depth First Search Algorithm is implemented iteratively using a stack to emulate the call stack.
The Stanford Library and API is used for data structure and displaying graphics to the consol window
